# Analysis of A^(-1) Structure in Pade Differentiation

*Technical Report - June 9, 2025*

## Overview

This report presents an analysis of the structure of the inverse of the coefficient matrix A in Pade differentiation schemes. Pade differentiation solves the linear problem A f' = B f, where A and B are matrices, f' is the resultant derivative vector, and f is the function vector. Understanding the structure of A^(-1) is important for numerical analysis, algorithm optimization, and error estimation in Pade differentiation schemes.

## Methodology

The analysis focused on:

1. Generating A matrices for both uniform and non-uniform grid spacings
2. Computing and visualizing A^(-1) for grid sizes ranging from 20 to 1000 points
3. Analyzing the structure of A^(-1) using logarithmic decade-based visualization
4. Investigating how the structure changes with grid size
5. Comparing the behavior between uniform and non-uniform grids

## Key Findings

### 1. Structure of A^(-1)

While the A matrix in Pade differentiation is tridiagonal, its inverse A^(-1) is dense with values that decay away from the diagonal. The decade-based logarithmic visualizations clearly show that the magnitude of elements decreases by orders of magnitude as we move away from the diagonal.

The zoomed visualizations reveal that the structure has a clear banded pattern with most significant values concentrated near the diagonal:

### 2. Bandwidth Properties

The effective bandwidth analysis shows that:

- Significant values (>0.01 of maximum) extend approximately 7 positions away from the diagonal
- Moderate values (>1e-4 of maximum) extend about 13 positions away
- Small values (>1e-6 of maximum) extend about 19 positions away
- Very small values (>1e-8 of maximum) extend up to 24 positions away for n=1000

The effective bandwidth increases with grid size but at a decreasing rate, suggesting a logarithmic growth pattern rather than linear.

### 3. Comparison Between Uniform and Non-uniform Grids

The analysis revealed interesting differences between uniform and non-uniform grid behavior:

#### Condition Number:
- Uniform grid A matrices have consistently high condition numbers (~1330) regardless of grid size
- Non-uniform grid condition numbers increase with grid size, approaching the uniform value for large n
- For n=1000, the condition numbers are 1330 (uniform) vs 1238 (non-uniform)

#### Maximum Value in A^(-1):
- For uniform grids, the maximum absolute value in A^(-1) remains constant (~150.4) regardless of grid size
- For non-uniform grids, the maximum value increases with grid size (from ~36.5 for n=20 to ~140.5 for n=1000)

#### Decay Pattern:
- Both grid types show similar decay patterns away from the diagonal
- Non-uniform grids may have slightly faster decay for smaller grid sizes

### 4. Practical Implications

The findings have several practical implications for Pade differentiation schemes:

1. **Numerical Stability**: Non-uniform grids may provide better numerical stability for smaller grid sizes due to lower condition numbers.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: The banded structure of A^(-1) suggests that approximations that exploit this structure could be developed.

3. **Error Propagation**: The decay pattern in A^(-1) helps understand how errors in function values propagate to derivative calculations.

4. **Grid Size Selection**: As grid size increases, the behavior of uniform and non-uniform grids becomes more similar, suggesting that the choice between them becomes less critical for very large grids.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the structure of the inverse coefficient matrix in Pade differentiation schemes. The results show that while A^(-1) is mathematically dense, its elements decay rapidly away from the diagonal, effectively giving it a banded structure. This structure is consistent across different grid sizes and types, though there are notable differences between uniform and non-uniform grid behaviors that could influence the choice of discretization in practical applications.

The findings support both theoretical understanding of Pade differentiation schemes and potential optimizations in their numerical implementation.
